## Introduction

(This repo really only contains the init system and scripts to make the initrd.cpio.gz)

Cotton OS will be an minimalistic linux distro that provides a custom init system, service managment system and a system managment system that are aiming at being memory efficiant and configurability, whilst offering support with popular software.

## Motivation

The main reason I'm making this is fun, but also because i thought it'd be a fun 10th Grade CS Project.

## History

I mean, the history of Cotton OS is not that long, like, i got linux for the 3ds, there only was buildroot. I wanted to make my own distro, but I quickly realized that the linux 3ds kernel isn't mature enough so I decided to stop. like a week later I though it would be fun to make the distro for x86_64 but still wanted to have minimal ram usage as a goal. Progress was going slowly, but it was goind (mostly research) after I found out we will get our own laptops (for like a year) to make a CS project on them, my motivation skyrocketed and i begann working on it again with these things in mind: minimal ram, not-bad service managment, some x-server running and a (possibly not good) package manager, or at least the base for one

## Compilation

To compile the the `init` executable execute `make all` <br>
To make the initrd just run `make initrd`

## Contributions

If you'd like to contribute to CottonOS, think again. It's my homework.
