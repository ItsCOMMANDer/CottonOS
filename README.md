## Introduction

(This repo really only contains the init system and scripts to make the initrd.cpio.gz)

Cotton OS will be an minimalistic linux distro that focuses on minimizing ram usage.

## Motivation

The main reason I'm making this is fun, but also because i thought it'd be a fun 10th Grade CS Project.

## Compilation

To compile the the `init` executable execute `make all` <br>
To make the initrd just run `make initrd`

## Contributions

If you'd like to contribute to CottonOS, think again. It's my homework.
